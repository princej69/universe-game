    "At the dawn of anything, you’re here. Alone in this big void and space. Nothing too see, nothing to hear, nothing to smell. However, you’re aware of yourself. You know you’re here for something great but you don’t know yet what it is.",
    "You look on the right, left, above, and below. You can only see the black, black, black, and black. Even so, as more time goes by, the more the environment seems familiar to you. By looking for a long time, your senses sharpen little by little and you’re starting to think about what you could do.",
    "The time goes on. You don’t know how much time, maybe 100 years, 1000 years, maybe more. You keep on drifting in this huge black space. Your intellectual abilities keep on developing. Time to think! Why won’t you look for something in this big space?",
    "Suddenly you notice that drifting in a specific way, it feels warmer and warmer. It’s so good and pleasant to be here. You close your eyes to appreciate the moment better. You’re starting to smile and enjoy this place. After a good time, you open your eyes. You seem to see something right under your nose. Is it possible? Did you become crazy? Or is it the reality?",
    "The object is so small that you have to concentrate and frown to discern its identity. Yes! This is it! A particle of infinitesimal matter. Fabulous! You’re definitely not alone. Your starting to laugh uncontrollablu so much your happy. It may be the end of this long period of solitude in the middle od this nameless nothingness.",
    "With the dexterity of an alchemist, you decide to move the tiny matter from side to side. Once, you heard that an explosion could be the collision of energy and matter. So, moving quickly this matter in this very hot Void, you’re hoping for something to happen.",
